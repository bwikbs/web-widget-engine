    <p class="one">This paragraph should be green, because only the
    rotation should be ignored.</p>
  
    <p class="oneb">This paragraph should be green, since
    error-checking should be done before calculating specificity.</p>
  
    <p class="two">This paragraph should have a solid gray background
    (or a white grid), because in CSS1, <code>inherit</code> is an
    invalid keyword, and in CSS2, it will cause the gray background
    (not the white grid) to be inherited.</p>
  
    <p class="three">This paragraph should be black, since in CSS1,
    the selector is invalid, and in CSS2, it does not apply.</p>
  
    <p class="four">This paragraph should be black, since in CSS1,
    the selector is invalid, and in CSS2, it does not apply.</p>
  
    <p class="five">This paragraph should have a white background,
    since keywords cannot be quoted.</p>
  
    <p class="sixa">This paragraph should have a medium-width border
    around it (the same as the next three paragraphs). This should
    cause the user agent to use the default value of 'medium'.</p>
  
    <p class="sixb">This paragraph should have a medium-width border
    around it (the same as the previous and the next two paragraphs),
    because the border-width is invalid. This should cause the user
    agent to use the default value of 'medium'.</p>
  
    <p class="sixc">This paragraph should have a medium-width border
    around it (the same as the next and the previous two paragraphs),
    because the border-width units are invalid, and therefore the
    border-width should be ignored. This should cause the user agent
    to use the default value of 'medium'.</p>
  
    <p class="sixd">This paragraph should have a medium-width border
    around it (the same as the previous three paragraphs), because
    the border-width does not have any value to go with its pixel
    unit, and is therefore invalid. This should cause the user agent
    to use the default value of 'medium'.</p>
  
    <p class="seven">This paragraph should be black, because the
    style declaration that applies to it is within an invalid
    at-rule.</p>
  
    <p class="eight">This paragraph should be green. CSS is
    case-insensitive, unless required to be case sensitive due to
    interaction with other standards (e.g., font names or URLs.)</p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>This ordered list item should be black, because the
      declaration has an invalid pseudo-class selector.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <p class="ten">This paragraph should be black, because, in CSS1,
    :first-child is an invalid pseudo-class, and in CSS2, this
    paragraph is not the first child.</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>This unordered list item should be black, because,
      according to CSS1, the selector is invalid, and according to
      CSS2, the selector should not apply.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <blockquote>
      This blockquote should be black, because, according to CSS1,
      the selector is invalid, and according to CSS2, the selector
      should not apply.
    </blockquote>
  
    <p><acronym>This acronym should be black, because, according to
    CSS1, the selector is invalid, and according to CSS2, the
    selector should not apply.</acronym></p>
  
    <address>
      This address should be black, because, according to CSS1, the
      selector is invalid, and according to CSS2, the selector should
      not apply.
    </address>
  
    <p><span>This span should be black, because, according to CSS1,
    the selector is invalid, and according to CSS2, the selector
    should not apply.</span></p>
  
    <p class="sixteen">This paragraph should be black, because the
    style declaration that applies to it is within an invalid
    at-rule. However, it is valid in CSS2, so if this is being viewed
    on a tty browser that supports CSS2, it should be red.</p>
  
    <p class="seventeen">This paragraph should be black, because the
    style declaration that applies to it is within an invalid
    at-rule.</p>
  
    <p class="eighteena">The text of this paragraph should be normal
    (that is, it should not be underlined, overlined, stricken, or
    bold), because <code>diagonal</code> is not a valid keyword,
    making the <code>text-decoration</code> invalid. In addition,
    <code>highlighted</code> is not a valid part of the
    <code>font</code> property, making it invalid. Therefore, this
    paragraph's font should be the UA default, and match the next
    paragraph. If this is not the case, then the <code>font</code>
    declaration is being improperly parsed.</p>
  
    <p class="eighteenb">The text of this paragraph should be normal
    (that is, it should not be underlined, overlined, stricken, or
    bold), because <code>diagonal</code> is not a valid keyword,
    making the <code>text-decoration</code> invalid. In addition,
    <code>highlighted</code> is not a valid part of the
    <code>font</code> property, making it invalid. Therefore, this
    paragraph's font should be the UA default, and match the previous
    paragraph. If this is not the case, then the <code>font</code>
    declaration is being improperly parsed.</p>
  
    <p class="nineteena">The text of this paragraph should be normal
    size because the selector is invalid. The <em>emphasized
    text</em> and the <strong>strong text</strong> within it should
    also be normal size, since the entire ruleset should be skipped
    (since in some future version of CSS, there could be an operator
    within the selector that has higher precedence than a comma).</p>
  
    <p class="nineteenb">This paragraph should be black, because the
    line before the declaration is <strong>not</strong> a comment and
    therefore the selector for P.nineteenb is invalid.</p>
  
    <p class="twentya">This paragraph should be blue, because only
    the first declaration is invalid.</p>
  
    <p class="twentyb">This paragraph should be green, because only
    the first declaration is invalid.</p>
  
    <p class="twentyonea">This paragraph should be purple, because
    only the first declaration is invalid.</p>
  
    <p class="twentyoneb">This paragraph should be green, because
    only the first declaration is invalid.</p>
  
    <p class="twentytwo">This paragraph should be green, because only
    the first declaration is invalid.</p>
  
    <p class="twentythree">This paragraph should be indented half an
    inch, but it should not be maroon. It should be black.</p>
  
    <p class="twentyfour">This paragraph should be black, because the
    color declaration after the previous ruleset should be considered
    part of the selector for this ruleset, and this ruleset therefore
    has an invalid selector and should not be applied.</p>
