 <body>
  <p class="one">
   This paragraph should be green, because only the rotation should be
   ignored.
  </p>
  <p class="oneb">
   This paragraph should be green, since error-checking should be done
   before calculating specificity.
  </p>
  <p class="two">
   This paragraph should have a solid gray background (or a white grid),
   because in CSS1, <code>inherit</code> is an invalid keyword, and in
   CSS2, it will cause the gray background (not the white grid) to be
   inherited.
  </p>
  <p class="three">
   This paragraph should be black, since in CSS1, the selector is
   invalid, and in CSS2, it does not apply.
  </p>
  <p class="four">
   This paragraph should be black, since in CSS1, the selector is
   invalid, and in CSS2, it does not apply.
  </p>
  <p class="five">
   This paragraph should have a white background, since keywords cannot
   be quoted.
  </p>
  <p class="sixa">
   This paragraph should have a medium-width border around it (the same
   as the next three paragraphs). This should cause the user agent to use
   the default value of 'medium'.
  </p>
  <p class="sixb">
   This paragraph should have a medium-width border around it (the same
   as the previous and the next two paragraphs), because the border-width
   is invalid. This should cause the user agent to use the default value
   of 'medium'.
  </p>
  <p class="sixc">
   This paragraph should have a medium-width border around it (the same
   as the next and the previous two paragraphs), because the border-width
   units are invalid, and therefore the border-width should be ignored.
   This should cause the user agent to use the default value of 'medium'.
  </p>
  <p class="sixd">
   This paragraph should have a medium-width border around it (the same
   as the previous three paragraphs), because the border-width does not
   have any value to go with its pixel unit, and is therefore invalid.
   This should cause the user agent to use the default value of 'medium'.
  </p>
  <p class="seven">
   This paragraph should be black, because the style declaration that
   applies to it is within an invalid at-rule.
  </p>
  <p class="eight">
   This paragraph should be green. CSS is case-insensitive, unless
   required to be case sensitive due to interaction with other standards
   (e.g., font names or URLs.)
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>This ordered list item should be black, because the declaration
   has an invalid pseudo-class selector.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="ten">
   This paragraph should be black, because, in CSS1, :first-child is an
   invalid pseudo-class, and in CSS2, this paragraph is not the first
   child.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>This unordered list item should be black, because, according to
   CSS1, the selector is invalid, and according to CSS2, the selector
   should not apply.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
   This blockquote should be black, because, according to CSS1, the
   selector is invalid, and according to CSS2, the selector should not
   apply.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   <acronym>This acronym should be black, because, according to CSS1, the
   selector is invalid, and according to CSS2, the selector should not
   apply.</acronym>
  </p>
  <address>
   This address should be black, because, according to CSS1, the selector
   is invalid, and according to CSS2, the selector should not apply.
  </address>
  <p>
   <span>This span should be black, because, according to CSS1, the
   selector is invalid, and according to CSS2, the selector should not
   apply.</span>
  </p>
  <p class="sixteen">
   This paragraph should be black, because the style declaration that
   applies to it is within an invalid at-rule. However, it is valid in
   CSS2, so if this is being viewed on a tty browser that supports CSS2,
   it should be red.
  </p>
  <p class="seventeen">
   This paragraph should be black, because the style declaration that
   applies to it is within an invalid at-rule.
  </p>
  <p class="eighteena">
   The text of this paragraph should be normal (that is, it should not be
   underlined, overlined, stricken, or bold), because
   <code>diagonal</code> is not a valid keyword, making the
   <code>text-decoration</code> invalid. In addition,
   <code>highlighted</code> is not a valid part of the <code>font</code>
   property, making it invalid. Therefore, this paragraph's font should
   be the UA default, and match the next paragraph. If this is not the
   case, then the <code>font</code> declaration is being improperly
   parsed.
  </p>
  <p class="eighteenb">
   The text of this paragraph should be normal (that is, it should not be
   underlined, overlined, stricken, or bold), because
   <code>diagonal</code> is not a valid keyword, making the
   <code>text-decoration</code> invalid. In addition,
   <code>highlighted</code> is not a valid part of the <code>font</code>
   property, making it invalid. Therefore, this paragraph's font should
   be the UA default, and match the previous paragraph. If this is not
   the case, then the <code>font</code> declaration is being improperly
   parsed.
  </p>
  <p class="nineteena">
   The text of this paragraph should be normal size because the selector
   is invalid. The <em>emphasized text</em> and the <strong>strong
   text</strong> within it should also be normal size, since the entire
   ruleset should be skipped (since in some future version of CSS, there
   could be an operator within the selector that has higher precedence
   than a comma).
  </p>
  <p class="nineteenb">
   This paragraph should be black, because the line before the
   declaration is <strong>not</strong> a comment and therefore the
   selector for P.nineteenb is invalid.
  </p>
  <p class="twentya">
   This paragraph should be blue, because only the first declaration is
   invalid.
  </p>
  <p class="twentyb">
   This paragraph should be green, because only the first declaration is
   invalid.
  </p>
  <p class="twentyonea">
   This paragraph should be purple, because only the first declaration is
   invalid.
  </p>
  <p class="twentyoneb">
   This paragraph should be green, because only the first declaration is
   invalid.
  </p>
  <p class="twentytwo">
   This paragraph should be green, because only the first declaration is
   invalid.
  </p>
  <p class="twentythree">
   This paragraph should be indented half an inch, but it should not be
   maroon. It should be black.
  </p>
  <p class="twentyfour">
   This paragraph should be black, because the color declaration after
   the previous ruleset should be considered part of the selector for
   this ruleset, and this ruleset therefore has an invalid selector and
   should not be applied.
