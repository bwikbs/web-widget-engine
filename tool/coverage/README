Update:

To be able to generate TC coverage report without running StarFish,
we include *.raw log files generated by running testcases. These files are
found in in/*raw. With these files, TC coverage reports are generated
by running the following command.
```
./genCoverage.sh
./combineCsv.sh
```

Tab-separated dom.csv, html.csv, css.csv files are generated.

=================

To generate coverage

1. compile escargot with TC_COVERAGE support
cd third_party/escargot
TC=1 make x64.interpreter.debug.static -j

2. compile StarFish with escargot with TC_COVERAGE
TC=1 make x64.exe.debug -j

3. run:
To generate coverage, run:
./genDomSpecList.sh
./genCssHtmlSpecList.sh
./genCoverage.sh
./combineCsv.sh

dom.csv, html.csv, css.csv files are generated.
